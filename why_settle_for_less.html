        <h1>Why Settle for Less?</h1>

        <p>Do you know the trend we made,  
        A fingerprint, hands, and feet displayed?  
        Symbols of us, on my phone it stayed,  
        A keepsake of the love we portrayed.</p>

        <p>It’s been there, untouched, since that day,  
        Our last together before I went away.  
        I guarded it like a precious song,  
        But now I see it’s been gone for long.</p>

        <p>I asked if yours remained the same,  
        That memory crafted in love’s name.  
        A plan I made with heart so true,  
        A trend, a dream, just us two.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, September twenty-seven,  
        I learned it's gone—my heart was broken.  
        What once brought smiles now brings me pain,  
        That core memory washed away in rain.</p>

        <p>So, I took mine down to ease the ache,  
        I’m tired of giving while others take.  
        You’d wonder why I feel this way,  
        But it’s not just the trend that’s led me astray.</p>

        <p>Where are the letters I wrote with care?  
        Are they hidden, does he still compare?  
        Does he read them, think of me too?  
        Does he love as deep as I always do?</p>

        <p>Why settle for less when love should be whole?  
        Why hold back when I’ve given my soul?</p>

        <p class="line-break">Why settle for less?</p>
